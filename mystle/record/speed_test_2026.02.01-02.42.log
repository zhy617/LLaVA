Reused 0 tokens from the previous frame.
Model Output: The driving scene can be described as a city street during rainy weather. The street appears to be wet from the rain, and the overall visibility might be impacted.

There is a large building on the right side of the road, which may obstruct the view slightly. There are at least two traffic lights in the scene, suggesting this is an intersection. The traffic lights seem to be off-white with clear lenses through which their lenses can be seen.

On the side of the road, there is a brown box that looks like a structure of some sort. The back-left camera shows a small orange traffic cone next to the structure.

No pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk. There is a white car parked up ahead, and it appears to be raining, as the drops can be seen against the image.

Predicting the behavior of the ego vehicle, consider the following:

- The ego vehicle's sensors might detect the wet road conditions affecting tire traction and making braking distance trade-offs more important.
- The ego vehicle is situated in the outside lane of a street with no traffic. However, the oncoming car appears to be parked, so the ego vehicle could proceed in its current lane if it's safe to do so without any intrusions from other vehicles.
- The ego vehicle should pay close attention to the traffic lights if they were to be activated and available.
- The ego vehicle should maintain an appropriate speed given the rainy conditions to ensure adequate reaction time to any potential hazards.

Given the image and descriptions, the ego vehicle should plan to proceed straight while maintaining an appropriate speed.

Reused 370 tokens from the previous frame.
Model Output: The driving scene can be described as a city street during rainy weather. The street appears to be wet from the rain, and the overall visibility might be impacted.

There is a large building on the right side of the road, which may obstruct the view slightly. There are at least two traffic lights in the scene, suggesting this is an intersection. The traffic lights seem to be off-white with clear lenses through which their lenses can be seen.

On the side of the road, there is a brown box that looks like a structure of some sort. The back-left camera shows a small orange traffic cone next to the structure.

No pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk. There is a white car parked up ahead, and it appears to be raining, as the drops can be seen against the image.

Predicting the behavior of the ego vehicle, consider the following:

- The ego vehicle's sensors might detect the wet road conditions affecting tire traction and making braking distance trade-offs more important.
- The ego vehicle is situated in the outside lane of a street with no traffic. However, the oncoming car appears to be parked, so the ego vehicle could proceed in its current lane if it's safe to do so without any intrusions from other vehicles.
- The ego vehicle should pay close attention to the traffic lights if they were to be activated and available.
- The ego vehicle should maintain an appropriate speed given the rainy conditions to ensure adequate reaction time to any potential hazards.

Given the image and descriptions, the ego vehicle should plan to proceed straight while maintaining an appropriate speed.

Reused 370 tokens from the previous frame.
Model Output: The driving scene can be described as a city street during rainy weather. The street appears to be wet from the rain, and the overall visibility might be impacted.

There is a large building on the right side of the road, which may obstruct the view slightly. There are at least two traffic lights in the scene, suggesting this is an intersection. The traffic lights seem to be off-white with clear lenses through which their lenses can be seen.

On the side of the road, there is a brown box that looks like a structure of some sort. The back-left camera shows a small orange traffic cone next to the structure.

No pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk. There is a white car parked up ahead, and it appears to be raining, as the drops can be seen against the image.

Predicting the behavior of the ego vehicle, consider the following:

- The ego vehicle's sensors might detect the wet road conditions affecting tire traction and making braking distance trade-offs more important.
- The ego vehicle is situated in the outside lane of a street with no traffic. However, the oncoming car appears to be parked, so the ego vehicle could proceed in its current lane if it's safe to do so without any intrusions from other vehicles.
- The ego vehicle should pay close attention to the traffic lights if they were to be activated and available.
- The ego vehicle should maintain an appropriate speed given the rainy conditions to ensure adequate reaction time to any potential hazards.

Given the image and descriptions, the ego vehicle should plan to proceed straight while maintaining an appropriate speed.

Reused 370 tokens from the previous frame.
Model Output: The driving scene can be described as a city street during rainy weather. The street appears to be wet from the rain, and the overall visibility might be impacted.

There is a large building on the right side of the road, which may obstruct the view slightly. There are at least two traffic lights in the scene, suggesting this is an intersection. The traffic lights seem to be off-white with clear lenses through which their lenses can be seen.

On the side of the road, there is a brown box that looks like a structure of some sort. The back-left camera shows a small orange traffic cone next to the structure.

No pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk. There is a white car parked up ahead, and it appears to be raining, as the drops can be seen against the image.

Predicting the behavior of the ego vehicle, consider the following:

- The ego vehicle's sensors might detect the wet road conditions affecting tire traction and making braking distance trade-offs more important.
- The ego vehicle is situated in the outside lane of a street with no traffic. However, the oncoming car appears to be parked, so the ego vehicle could proceed in its current lane if it's safe to do so without any intrusions from other vehicles.
- The ego vehicle should pay close attention to the traffic lights if they were to be activated and available.
- The ego vehicle should maintain an appropriate speed given the rainy conditions to ensure adequate reaction time to any potential hazards.

Given the image and descriptions, the ego vehicle should plan to proceed straight while maintaining an appropriate speed.

Reused 370 tokens from the previous frame.
Model Output: The driving scene can be described as a city street during rainy weather. The street appears to be wet from the rain, and the overall visibility might be impacted.

There is a large building on the right side of the road, which may obstruct the view slightly. There are at least two traffic lights in the scene, suggesting this is an intersection. The traffic lights seem to be off-white with clear lenses through which their lenses can be seen.

On the side of the road, there is a brown box that looks like a structure of some sort. The back-left camera shows a small orange traffic cone next to the structure.

No pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk. There is a white car parked up ahead, and it appears to be raining, as the drops can be seen against the image.

Predicting the behavior of the ego vehicle, consider the following:

- The ego vehicle's sensors might detect the wet road conditions affecting tire traction and making braking distance trade-offs more important.
- The ego vehicle is situated in the outside lane of a street with no traffic. However, the oncoming car appears to be parked, so the ego vehicle could proceed in its current lane if it's safe to do so without any intrusions from other vehicles.
- The ego vehicle should pay close attention to the traffic lights if they were to be activated and available.
- The ego vehicle should maintain an appropriate speed given the rainy conditions to ensure adequate reaction time to any potential hazards.

Given the image and descriptions, the ego vehicle should plan to proceed straight while maintaining an appropriate speed.

Model Output: The driving scene appears to be in a suburban area with a mix of residential and commercial buildings. The road is lined with trees and there are sidewalks on both sides. The sky is overcast, suggesting it might be a cool or cloudy day.

Key factors for driving planning include:

1. The presence of a bus in the middle lane, which is turning right.
2. A car in the right lane, which is also turning right.
3. A bicycle parked on the sidewalk, indicating a bike-friendly area.
4. A pedestrian walking on the sidewalk, suggesting a pedestrian-friendly area.
5. A traffic light ahead, which is currently not visible in the images.

Predictions for ego vehicle behavior:

1. The ego vehicle should slow down and prepare to turn right, following the bus and the car in front of it.
2. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the bus and the car in front of it, as they are turning right.
3. The ego vehicle should be prepared to stop if necessary, as there is a pedestrian on the sidewalk.
4. The ego vehicle should be cautious of the bicycle parked on the sidewalk, as it may be obstructing the view of pedestrians or other vehicles.
5. The ego vehicle should be aware of the traffic light ahead and adjust its speed accordingly.

Please note that these predictions are based on the available information and do not take into account any additional context or the driver's intentions.

Model Output: The driving scene is set on a two-lane highway. A rightful yellow bus is now in front of us, driving on the right side of the road. The bus is the key obstacle on our route, and it appears to be moving at a normal speed. To the right of the bus, there is an additional lane that is currently clear. In the opposite lane, there are no immediate obstacles, but the scene shows construction work which might require traffic management.

From the camera angles provided, it is not possible to determine the ego vehicle's direction or speed. However, here is a possible interpretation based on the assumption that the bus is following the lane it is currently in and considering the visibility of the surrounding infrastructure:

1. **First Front Image**: No obstacles in the immediate vicinity. The bus in the next lane looks normal in size and speed, and it stays within its lane.
2. **First Back Image**: No obstacles in the immediate vicinity. The bus in the next lane looks normal in size and speed, and it stays within its lane.
3. **Second Back Image**: No notable obstacles that seem to be relevant to driving planning. The bus in the next lane looks normal in size and speed, and it stays within its lane.
4. **Third Back Image**: No notable obstacles that seem to be relevant to driving planning. The bus in the next lane looks normal in size and speed, and it stays within its lane.
5. **Fourth Back Image**: No notable obstacles that seem to be relevant to driving planning. The bus in the next lane looks normal in size and speed, and it stays within its lane.
6. **Fifth Back Image**: No notable obstacles that seem to be relevant to driving planning. The bus in the next lane looks normal in size and speed, and it stays within its lane.
7. **Sixth Back Image**: No notable obstacles that seem to be relevant to driving planning. The bus in the next lane looks normal in size and speed, and it stays within its lane.

Given the amount of time it seems like the distance to the bus seeing and other small enough, a sudden braking suddenly slows other sudden after the bad we can which might indicate road might have to suddenly make a sudden braking with the white lines in front of the bus has to be suddenly slows the other side.

Prediction:
The ego vehicle accelerates and takes a left turn with personal riding on a two-lane road. Eye climb a tree.

Model Output: The driving scene is set on a two-lane highway. A rightful yellow bus is now in front of us, driving on the right side of the road. The bus is the key obstacle on our route, and it appears to be moving at a normal speed. To the right of the bus, there is an additional lane that is currently clear. In the opposite lane, there are no immediate obstacles, but the scene shows construction work which might require traffic management.

From the camera angles provided, it is not possible to determine the ego vehicle's direction or speed. However, here is a possible interpretation based on the assumption that the bus is following the lane it is currently in and considering the visibility of the surrounding infrastructure:

1. **First Front Image**: No obstacles in the immediate vicinity. The bus in the next lane looks normal in size and speed, and it stays within its lane.
2. **First Back Image**: No obstacles in the immediate vicinity. The bus in the next lane looks normal in size and speed, and it stays within its lane.
3. **Second Back Image**: No notable obstacles that seem to be relevant to driving planning. The bus in the next lane looks normal in size and speed, and it stays within its lane.
4. **Third Back Image**: No notable obstacles that seem to be relevant to driving planning. The bus in the next lane looks normal in size and speed, and it stays within its lane.
5. **Fourth Back Image**: No notable obstacles that seem to be relevant to driving planning. The bus in the next lane looks normal in size and speed, and it stays within its lane.
6. **Fifth Back Image**: No notable obstacles that seem to be relevant to driving planning. The bus in the next lane looks normal in size and speed, and it stays within its lane.
7. **Sixth Back Image**: No notable obstacles that seem to be relevant to driving planning. The bus in the next lane looks normal in size and speed, and it stays within its lane.

Given the amount of time it seems like the distance to the bus AfterPA0	 spiritual. che

Model Output: Here is a description of the driving scene:

- The road is clear, with no visible obstacles.
- On the far right side of the road, there is a white garage.
- In front of the garage, there are some bushes.
- To the right of this garage, there is a small building with a slanted roof.
- On the opposite side of the road, there are trees and greenery.
- The sky is overcast with no rain visible, but it is pitch dark outside.
- The road itself is grey asphalt, with white dotted lines indicating parking lanes.

Taking this information into account, the behavior of the ego vehicle would be as follows:

1. Driving direction: The vehicle would continue straight ahead as the road appears clear ahead.
2. Driving speed: The vehicle would likely be slowing down or has stopped already, as the road conditions indicate that driving slowly would be the appropriate speed in current conditions.

Please note that on a pitch darkness road like this, driving slow would be the safer choice, due to the absence of warning lights or other traffic signs that may indicate a serious issue ahead.

Reused 236 tokens from the previous frame.
Model Output: The driving scene:

1. Key Factors:
   - The road has a clear view for the car with no visible obstacles like cyclists, pedestrians, or other vehicles, and no busy road ahead.
   - Traffic lights are visible at two different points in the scene, but their current state isn't clear from the images.

2. Predictions:
   - The ego vehicle is approaching a four-way intersection.
   - There is a chance for unexpected vehicles or pedestrians emerging from within the frame on both left and right, suggesting the driver needs to be extra cautious.
   - The vehicle appears to be in motion but seems to be moving at a slow speed.
   - The lighting in the scene is natural, with overcast conditions. No indication of heavy traffic.

Predictions:
The ego vehicle will proceed straight at the intersection, as there is no indication of signaling or initiating a turn. The speed will remain slow, given the overcast conditions and the need for caution in approaching the intersection.

Reused 0 tokens from the previous frame.
Model Output: The driving scene is set on a city street. The key factors indicating good driving conditions include a clear road ahead, no oncoming traffic, and no pedestrians or cyclists in the front-left and front-right camera views. The back-left camera shows cars already parked alongside the curb, which doesn't lead to immediate traffic slowdowns. The back-right camera shows more empty space with cars that might be turning in or out, but their movement appears to be marginal.

From the driving direction, the ego vehicle is already moving forward on the street, so it probably indicates a straight driving direction.

Reused 222 tokens from the previous frame.
Model Output: The driving scene is set on a city street. The key factors indicating good driving conditions include a clear road ahead, no oncoming traffic, and no pedestrians or cyclists in the front-left and front-right camera views. The back-left camera shows cars already parked alongside the curb, which doesn't lead to immediate traffic slowdowns. The back-right camera shows more empty space with cars that might be turning in or out, but their movement appears to be marginal.

From the driving direction, the ego vehicle is already moving forward on the street, so it probably indicates a straight driving direction. As for the driving speed, the ego vehicle is maintaining its current speed, which suggests a normal driving pace. There appears to be no immediate pressing need for the car to decelerate or change direction due to current driving conditions.

It's important to note that the assessment is based solely on the given camera views and does not take into account any additional context or details that may not be immediately apparent from these images.

Reused 222 tokens from the previous frame.
Model Output: The driving scene is set on a city street. The key factors indicating good driving conditions include a clear road ahead, no oncoming traffic, and no pedestrians or cyclists in the front-left and front-right camera views. The back-left camera shows cars already parked alongside the curb, which doesn't lead to immediate traffic slowdowns. The back-right camera shows more empty space with cars that might be turning in or out, but their movement appears to be marginal.

From the driving direction, the ego vehicle is already moving forward on the street, so it probably indicates a straight driving direction. As for the driving speed, the ego vehicle is maintaining its current speed, which suggests a normal driving pace. There appears to be no immediate pressing need for the car to decelerate or change direction due to current driving conditions.

It's important to note that the assessment is based solely on the given camera views and does not take into account any additional context or details that may not be immediately apparent from these images.

Model Output: The driving scene appears to be at night, with the street illuminated by streetlights. The road is relatively clear, with no visible obstacles or pedestrians. There are no traffic lights in the immediate vicinity, suggesting that the car is in a less regulated area or that the traffic lights are not visible in the captured images.

The car's front camera shows the vehicle in motion, with the headlights on, indicating that the car is driving at a moderate speed. The front-left and front-right cameras show the car's side profile, with the vehicle's headlights illuminating the road ahead. The back camera shows the car's rear view, with the taillights visible. The back-left and back-right cameras show the car's side profile, with the taillights and side mirrors visible.

Given the image data, the ego vehicle is driving straight ahead, as there are no visible obstacles or turns that would require a change in direction. The driving speed appears to be moderate, as the car's headlights are on and the vehicle is not making any sudden maneuvers. The car's position on the road suggests that it is in the center lane, and there are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the captured images.

Model Output: The driving scene appears to be at night, with the street illuminated by streetlights and the headlights of the vehicles. The road is relatively clear, with no visible obstacles or pedestrians in the immediate vicinity. There are no traffic lights visible in the images provided.

The ego vehicle is captured in the front-left camera image, indicating that it is currently driving on the left side of the road. The vehicle is moving at a moderate speed, as suggested by the blurred appearance of the image, which indicates motion.

Given the absence of any immediate obstacles or pedestrians, and the lack of traffic lights, the ego vehicle should continue driving straight ahead. The speed of the vehicle appears to be moderate, as it is not moving at a fast pace, nor is it moving at a slow speed. The driver should maintain this speed and direction until the next turn or change in road conditions.

Model Output: The driving scene appears to be at night, with the street illuminated by streetlights and the headlights of the vehicles. The road is wet, suggesting recent rain, which could affect traction and visibility.

Key factors for driving planning include:

1. The presence of obstacles: There are no visible obstacles in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle.
2. The positions and movements of vehicles and pedestrians: The image shows a car in the front-right lane, which is moving forward. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the immediate vicinity.
3. Traffic lights: There are no traffic lights visible in the image.

Predicting the behavior of the ego vehicle:

Given the image, the ego vehicle should continue driving straight ahead at a normal speed. There are no indications of a need to turn left or right, and no obstacles or pedestrians are present that would require a change in direction or speed. The wet road conditions should be taken into account, but the vehicle's headlights and the streetlights should provide adequate illumination for safe driving.

Model Output: The driving scene is taking place on a dimly lit, empty street at night. The view from the front-left camera provides a clear view of the road ahead. There is a solid white line dividing the sidewalk from the roadway. The back camera shows a rear-end view, with another car visible behind the ego vehicle. There are no pedestrians or traffic lights visible in the captured images.

Predictions:
- The ego vehicle is continuing to move forward towards the opposite end of the street.
- The ego vehicle has turned off the side of the road it was originally on and is headed towards a block of dark buildings to its left.
- The visibility is minimal due to night-time conditions, but there does not appear to be any immediate obstruction on the road that would require turning or drastic slowing of the car.
- The ego vehicle should proceed with caution, as the road is dark and there may be limited visual cues, slowing down to a reasonable speed.

Reused 218 tokens from the previous frame.
Model Output: The driving scene is taking place on a dimly lit, empty street at night. The view from the front-left camera provides a clear view of the road ahead. There is a solid white line dividing the sidewalk from the roadway. The back camera shows a rear-end view, with another car visible behind the ego vehicle. There are no pedestrians or traffic lights visible in the captured images.

Predictions:
- The ego vehicle is continuing to move forward towards the opposite end of the street.
- The ego vehicle has turned off the side of the road it was originally on and is headed towards a block of dark buildings to its left.
- The visibility is minimal due to night-time conditions, but there does not appear to be any immediate obstruction on the road that would require turning or drastic slowing of the car.
- The ego vehicle should proceed with caution, as the road is dark and there may be limited visual cues, slowing down to a reasonable speed.
