Reused 0 tokens from the previous frame.
Model Output: The driving scene depicted in the six images shows a dry, windy day, with slightly visible traffic lights. The intersection is deserted except for the vehicles and construction equipment. In the front camera view, the ego vehicle is moving forward towards the intersection.

There is no suspension of driver's organs or cargo or unbearable risk of the unusual. There is no dense fog, poisoned fog, greatly heavy traffic, or extremely strong wind. Occupants of other vehicles cannot predict this car's route precisely. Speed must be reduced probably to less than 40 miles per hour. Protective gear must be worn at car, truck, and construction vehicle speeds.

To identify the behavior of the ego vehicle, consider that pedestrians aren't visible in these images, and traffic conditions are seemingly clear apart from the wind. The clearest feature is the position of the construction equipment, which is to the right and behind the ego vehicle. Therefore, the ego vehicle might turn right to follow the construction equipment without overtaking.

The speed of the ego vehicle seems to be at a normal or slightly reduced pace as recommended by the health of all parties, including the vehicle itself.

Model Output: The driving scene depicted in the six images shows a dry, windy day, with slightly visible traffic lights. The intersection is deserted except for the vehicles and construction equipment. In the front camera view, the ego vehicle is moving forward towards the intersection.

There is no suspension of driver's organs or cargo or unbearable risk of the unusual. There is no dense fog, poisoned fog, greatly heavy traffic, or extremely strong wind. Occupants of other vehicles cannot predict this car's route precisely. Speed must be reduced time to the curve.

Predicting the behavior of the ego vehicle, using the limited information from the front-left and front-right images, it appears to be currently in motion, going low to the ground. Straight without issue is recommended. The driver's attention must be alert for any sudden occurrence. However, speed reduction is not necessary due to the nearly empty road and clear visibility. It is probably already there.

Pedestrians are not visible beyond the inside of a parked vehicle to the right. Cyclists are not possible given the nature of the day. With the unusual visibility, no traffic signals are severe that supplement speed management. No need to turn, only pay attention to the huge construction. No traffic signals are visible, which can disorient drivers when providing other values of motion.

Reused 116 tokens from the previous frame.
Model Output: The driving scene depicted in the six images shows a dry, windy day, with slightly visible traffic lights. The intersection is deserted except for the vehicles and construction equipment. In the front camera view, the ego vehicle is moving forward towards the intersection.

There is no suspension of driver's organs or cargo or unbearable risk of the unusual. There is no dense fog, poisoned fog, greatly heavy traffic, or extremely strong wind. Occupants of other vehicles cannot predict this car's route precisely. Speed must be reduced sufficiently safely to the point we've go gray. A decision must be made whether to turn left or right at the most. May need to get slightly ahead of construction vehicles to pass. Turn needs to go slow.

Reused 160 tokens from the previous frame.
Model Output: The driving scene depicted in the six images shows a dry, windy day, with slightly visible traffic lights. The intersection is deserted except for the vehicles and construction equipment. In the front camera view, the ego vehicle is moving forward towards the intersection.

There is no suspension of driver's organs or cargo or unbearable risk of the unusual. There is no dense fog, poisoned fog, greatly heavy traffic, or extremely strong wind. Occupants of other vehicles cannot predict this car's route precisely. Speed must be reduced sufficiently safely to the point we've go gray. A decision must be made whether to turn left or right at the most. May need to get slightly ahead of construction vehicles to pass. Turn needs to go slow.
