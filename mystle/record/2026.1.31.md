Model Output: The driving scene appears to be in a city area, possibly near an industrial or commercial area given the presence of a large building and a parking lot. The road is wet, suggesting recent rain, which could affect visibility and traction.

Key factors for driving planning include:

1. The presence of a large building on the right side of the road, which might limit visibility around the corner.
2. A parking lot with several cars parked, which could be entering or exiting the lot, potentially causing traffic flow changes.
3. A truck parked on the side of the road, which could be obstructing the view of oncoming traffic.
4. A pedestrian crossing visible on the right side of the road, indicating the need to be cautious of pedestrians.
5. A traffic light visible on the left side of the road, which could be controlling the flow of traffic.

Predictions for ego vehicle behavior:

1. The ego vehicle should approach the intersection with caution, as there might be oncoming traffic from the large building or the parking lot.
2. The ego vehicle should be prepared to slow down or stop if necessary to yield to pedestrians crossing the road.
3. The ego vehicle should be aware of the traffic light and follow the signal accordingly.
4. The ego vehicle should be prepared to turn left or right, depending on the traffic flow and the presence of any obstacles or pedestrians.
5. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe speed, considering the wet road conditions and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians.
